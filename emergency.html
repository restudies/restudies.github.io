        <p>You’re not okay. You know that. But no one seems to take it seriously — because your body still moves, your mouth still works, and your eyes still fake presence.</p>
        <p>Inside, though? Something broke. Not just depression. Not just anxiety. Something deeper.</p>
        <p>The feeling that you don’t know who you are anymore. Or worse — that you never did.</p>
        <p>That’s what this book is about.</p>
        <p>It’s not a memoir. It’s not self-help. It’s a black box recording of a psychic crash. The wreckage of identity.</p>
        <p>You won’t find steps. You won’t find platitudes. But you will find something human, raw, and true. Something that might echo where you're stuck. Something that might keep you breathing.</p>
        <p>Because this isn’t about finding out who you are. It’s about finally feeling what’s left when the lies fall off.</p>
        <p>You won’t read this like a story. You’ll read it like you’re combing through the aftermath, trying to understand what happened to you through someone else’s wreckage.</p>
        <p>And somewhere in it, you might find the moment when the collapse turned quiet, and the quiet turned real.</p>

        <h3>Reading This Book</h3>
        <p>This isn’t a traditional narrative. It’s not structured around events or lessons. It’s shaped by turning points — those moments when something cracked, broke, shifted, or revealed itself.</p>
        <p>Some chapters span a lifetime. Some focus on a single second. What matters isn’t how long they are, but how true they feel.</p>
        <p>If you’re lost, hollow, or numb, don’t expect to be rescued here. Expect to be met.</p>
        <p>Not with instructions. But with language that might name what you haven’t been able to say. And maybe that’s what survival really needs.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <p>This isn’t about answers. This is about what stays when the asking burns away.</p>
        <p>What remains when you stop trying to fix yourself, and just sit with what’s still alive inside.</p>
        <p><strong>That is the real beginning.</strong></p>
